# Digits_of_Pi_Circuit

Phase I (Conceptual Design Specification)
The design specification describes the problem that is solved by the circuit (i.e. what it is supposed to do). It also clears up any potential ambiguities in the circuit behaviour.

Phase II (Logic Design and Verification)
Description and verification of the logic necessary for the circuit. It also includes an equation for each output of the circuit (a sum-of-products equation).
The final logic equations have been tested on a computer algebra system, Maxima.

Phase III (Schematic Design and Simulation)
Includes a logic diagram, screenshots of the circuit simulation and an Input/Output Diagram that shows all the connections and chips to be used in the circuit.
